I like the inbox and next idea, but I need to be able to have a small inbox and next and a way to organize "this, then this, then this" for an individual project. They can't all live in inbox and next, especially things I haven't broken down yet.

Inbox means I'm processing it and it doesn't live there.

What do I really want for my dashboard? - if I'm looking at a day, I kind of want my daily note instead and a place I can quickly jot notes.
