# Pressure Test & Extension: Context Library for Engineering Managers

## Summary of the Original Vision

The conversation in 001.txt outlines a "personal shadow context library" approach:
- Build reusable "context packs" (project, domain, system)
- Capture context exhaust from meetings, decisions, incidents
- Store in a private repo/Obsidian vault you control
- Package on-demand for LLM requests (tickets, docs)
- Share outward later once proven valuable

The goal: eliminate the "prompt tax" of rewriting context for every LLM interaction.

## Pressure Testing the Ideas

### What's Strong

1. **The "capture → distill → canonicalize → package" pipeline is sound.**
   Most knowledge work already produces artifacts (PRs, meeting notes, decisions).
   The insight is to harvest and structure them rather than create from scratch.

2. **PARA + context packs is a good fit.**
   Projects = time-bound initiatives with packs
   Areas = operating norms, team standards
   Resources = domain knowledge, system docs
   This maps well to how an EM actually thinks about their work.

3. **"Shadow library first, share later" is politically smart.**
   You don't need buy-in. You build value privately, then let quality
   pull others in. This avoids the "empty wiki" problem.

4. **ADRs as the "context engine" is high-ROI.**
   Decisions are the highest-value context. They explain why things are
   the way they are. Everything else (code, config, process) follows.

### What Needs Strengthening

1. **The "2-minute capture" habit is fragile.**

   Problem: Willpower-based habits decay. After a busy week, the inbox
   grows stale and the weekly distill gets skipped.

   Mitigation: Tie capture to existing workflows. Don't add a step;
   hijack an existing one.
   - After every meeting: Gemini summary → structured note in Obsidian
   - After every decision: CLI command or Claude skill → ADR draft

   Better: Make the tool capture for you. If AIorgianization tracks
   your tasks, it can also track decisions, blockers, and context.

2. **"Context pack assembly" is still manual.**

   Problem: You still have to decide which packs to include. With 5
   projects and 10 domains, that's cognitive overhead.

   Mitigation: Encode relationships. If a task belongs to Project X,
   and Project X touches Domain Y and System Z, the tool should
   suggest the relevant packs automatically.

   This is where the task manager + Obsidian integration becomes
   powerful: tasks link to notes, notes link to packs, AI gets the
   full graph.

3. **The model assumes mostly text output (tickets, docs).**

   Problem: EMs also need context for verbal work: 1:1s, stakeholder
   updates, skip-levels, interviews. These don't produce written
   artifacts but consume the same context.

   Extension: Build "briefing packs" for recurring meetings:
   - 1:1 with Sarah → her recent tasks + waiting-for items + notes
   - Leadership update → project status + risks + decisions
   - Skip-level → team health + escalations + wins

   AIorgianization could generate these as a "review" feature.

4. **No mention of decay and freshness.**

   Problem: Context goes stale. A 6-month-old system one-pager may be
   wrong. An ADR from 2 years ago may be superseded.

   Mitigation: Add freshness metadata (already suggested in 001.txt)
   but also build decay alerts:
   - "System-payments.md hasn't been updated in 90 days"
   - "ADR-caching-strategy is marked 'revisit when traffic > 10k'
     and we hit 15k last week"

   This requires the tool to track metrics/events and cross-reference
   with the "revisit when" triggers.

5. **The MCP/Cursor integration is hand-wavy.**

   Problem: "Stand up MCP connectors" is easy to say, hard to do.
   External APIs have auth complexity, rate limits, and data
   sensitivity concerns.

   Realistic path (MVP):
   - Phase 1: Local files only (Obsidian vault). No external API.
   - Phase 2: Read-only integration for Obsidian (filesystem)
   - Phase 3: Jira API for team task sync

   Keep external integrations minimal. Most context should live in
   your local library (Obsidian), not scattered across SaaS tools.

## Connecting to AIorgianization

The 001.txt conversation and AIorgianization are solving adjacent problems:

| 001.txt Focus | AIorgianization Focus |
|---------------|----------------------|
| What context do I have? | What tasks do I have? |
| Why did we decide X? | What's due when? |
| How do I write tickets/docs? | How do I track delegation? |
| Eliminate prompt tax | Eliminate task tracking chaos |

**The synthesis:** A single system that tracks both TASKS and CONTEXT,
linked together.

### How They Merge

1. **Tasks link to context.**
   Every task can reference:
   - Project pack (via projectId)
   - Obsidian note (via obsidianNotePath)
   - ADR (via a new adrs[] field or tag)
   - System pack (via a new system field)

2. **Context informs task breakdown.**
   When you run `aio breakdown "Improve payment reliability"`:
   - Pull the project pack for context
   - Pull the domain pack (payments) for constraints
   - Pull the system pack (payment-api) for current state
   - AI generates subtasks with full awareness

3. **Tasks generate context.**
   When you complete a task tagged as "decision":
   - Prompt: "Would you like to create an ADR for this decision?"
   - Auto-populate context from the task + linked notes

   When you complete a task tagged as "incident":
   - Prompt: "Would you like to create an incident nugget?"

4. **Weekly review surfaces context gaps.**
   During `aio review`, the tool could flag:
   - "Project Q4-Migration has no linked ADRs"
   - "System payment-api hasn't been updated in 60 days"
   - "You made 3 decisions this week with no ADRs"

## Extended Vision: The EM Operating System

If we take both visions to their conclusion, we get something bigger:
An "Engineering Manager Operating System" that handles:

### Layer 1: Task & Time Management (GTD)
- Inbox → Next Actions → Waiting For → Someday
- Delegation tracking with follow-up reminders
- Weekly review workflow
- Calendar-aware scheduling (future)

### Layer 2: Context Library (BASB + Context Packs)
- Project packs (auto-generated from tasks + notes)
- Domain packs (manually curated, AI-assisted)
- System packs (could sync from repo READMEs)
- ADR library (captured from decisions)
- Meeting notes (structured from Gemini summaries)

### Layer 3: AI Generation Layer
- Ticket writing (context pack → ticket draft)
- Doc writing (context pack → doc draft)
- Briefing generation (tasks + notes → 1:1 prep)
- Decision recommendations ("Based on your constraints...")

### Layer 4: External Sync (MVP)
- Jira: team task visibility
- Obsidian: knowledge base

### Layer 5: Insights (Future)
- "You've delegated 12 tasks to Sarah, 3 are overdue"
- "Project X has no progress in 2 weeks"
- "You're spending 60% of time on Area Y, 10% on Area Z"
- "This ADR contradicts ADR-42 from last year"

## Concrete Next Steps

To move toward this vision incrementally:

### Already Planned (Phases 1-5)
- Task CRUD with GTD statuses ✓
- Obsidian vault reading
- Jira sync
- Claude skills + MCP
- Weekly review

### New Additions to Consider

**Phase 2 additions:**
- Add `systemId` field to tasks (links to system packs)
- Add `tags` field for semantic categorization (decision, incident, etc.)
- Create "context pack" as a first-class entity (or use Obsidian folders)

**Phase 4 additions:**
- When syncing Obsidian, index notes by type (project-pack, domain-pack, etc.)
- Build context assembly: given a task, find related packs automatically

**Phase 5 additions:**
- AI ticket generation: task + context packs → GitHub issue
- AI doc generation: context packs → Confluence-ready markdown
- Briefing generator: upcoming 1:1s → prep notes with relevant tasks/context

**Phase 6 additions:**
- Freshness tracking: flag stale packs
- Decision capture: prompt for ADR when closing "decision" tasks
- Context gap detection: surface missing packs during review

## Open Questions

1. **How much structure to impose on Obsidian?**
   - Option A: Require specific folders/frontmatter (more reliable)
   - Option B: Infer from content (more flexible, less reliable)
   - Recommendation: Start with A, add B later via AI classification

2. **Should context packs live in Obsidian or in the tool?**
   - Option A: Obsidian is source of truth, tool indexes it
   - Option B: Tool has its own pack storage, syncs to Obsidian
   - Recommendation: A. Don't duplicate. Obsidian is the editor; tool is the indexer.

3. **How to handle sensitive context?**
   - Some packs contain info you wouldn't send to external AI
   - Need a "safe for LLM" flag per pack/note
   - Need local-only AI option (Ollama, local Claude) for sensitive work

4. **How to prevent context library from becoming another unmaintained wiki?**
   - Tie updates to workflow (task completion → pack update prompt)
   - Freshness alerts with snooze
   - Minimal viable structure (don't over-template)
   - AI-assisted updates ("Here's what changed in this system, update the pack?")

## Summary

The 001.txt vision is solid: build a personal context library, structured for
LLM use, grown incrementally, shared later. The main risks are:
1. Habit decay (mitigation: automate capture, tie to existing workflows)
2. Manual assembly (mitigation: encode relationships, auto-suggest packs)
3. Staleness (mitigation: freshness tracking, decay alerts)

AIorgianization is the natural home for this system. Tasks and context are
two sides of the same coin: tasks are "what you're doing," context is
"why and how." Linking them creates an EM operating system that:
- Tracks work across people and teams
- Maintains institutional knowledge
- Eliminates prompt tax for AI interactions
- Surfaces gaps and staleness automatically

The extended vision is ambitious but achievable incrementally. Start with
tasks + Obsidian integration, then layer on AI generation and insights.
